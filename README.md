Green Rectangle - wall

## How to Play
You are able to move the orange rectangle side to side using your arrow keys. Your objective is to shoot down as many enemies as possible without letting the enemies reach the bottom which will make the game end. You only have 10 bullets at a time and it takes a few seconds to reload so use them wisely. All enemies trickle down from the top of the screen. If you collect the yellow circles, you will be able to move side to side faster. The walls can protect you from enemies if the enemies fall directly on the walls. The walls will break when it gets hit too many times.
